OXFORD VGG Face dataset

The dataset consists of the crawled images of celebrities on the
Web. There are 2622 celebrities in the dataset and the dataset is
designed to have no overlap with the popular face recognition
benchmarks such as Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), YouTube Faces
Dataset and IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A).

Since the original images are subject to copyright, we do not make
them available directly. We instead provide URLs and associated face
detections from the dataset.

The images are covered under a Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (Please read the
license terms here. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

Downloading this dataset implies agreement to follow the same
conditions of non-commercial research for any modification and/or
re-distribution of the dataset in any form.
